<h2>Master Data Warehouse for Enterprise Integration</h2>

<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Fragmented data across multiple systems created manual inefficiencies and unreliable reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced manual data processing by 80% and established a unified source of truth for enterprise reporting, streamlining analytics operations significantly.</p>
